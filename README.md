# Easy_YT-DLP

This is an extremely small shell script designed to make simple tasks with the CLI youtube downloader [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) easier to excecute. I have designed this to work on MacOS, but the script is so simple that if you wanted to get it running on a Linux/Unix based machine, you would be able to modify any filepaths to fit with how you would like it.

# Prerequisites

You must have yt-dlp installed. On MacOS you can do this by running `brew install yt-dlp`, and once that installs, you can run this script and you are good to go.
